# Predicting IMDb Movie Ratings

The goal of our project was to create a model that could best predict the average ratings that viewers would give a movie in the United States based on different predictor variables. The data we used was obtained from a Kaggle dataset, which was created by Stefano Leone. The data was from the IMDb database. We cleaned and filtered the data, then performed an exploratory data analysis. Finally, we explored multiple modeling techniques with different combinations of variables. Our most successful model was a linear regression model using duration, budget, USA gross income, metascore, and director average as the predictor variables.
