# Background

Previous projects have been done using the same IMDb database. One study used K-means clustering to predict the success of movies. They predicted that word of mouth might be a key component to the success of movies, which is difficult to quantify and is not well represented in the IMDb data (Meenakshi). Another study compared the reliability of ratings between the movie rating websites IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, and Fandango (Olteanu). The IMDb website allows anyone to review a movie, and they collect a lot of information about the movies and users.
